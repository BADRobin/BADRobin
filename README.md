  I am in the process of learning the Java programming language. In my country, I finished my studies at a private programming school. I completed the tests, passed the final exams and got the Junior Java Developer certification

  I already have several finished projects in my account. 4 projects are Web-applications (there is also written with Spring Boot) and one for a desktop. One of them is written in PHP. 
I'm currently working on improving my knowledge. Learning new skills and expanding my possibilities. 
Right now, I'm currently studying at [DCI](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/) (Digital Career Institute)
